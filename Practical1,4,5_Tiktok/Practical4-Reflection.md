# TikTok Frontend + Backend Integration Reflection

## Main Concepts Applied

In this practical, I connected a Next.js frontend to an Express.js backend to build a functional TikTok-style web application. I applied key concepts including:
* **API client configuration** using Axios for centralized HTTP requests
* **JWT-based authentication** for secure user sessions and route protection
* **React Context API** for global authentication state management
* **Secure frontend-backend communication** with automatic token attachment
* **Video interaction features** including likes, comments, and social engagement
* **Social features implementation** such as following users and personalized feeds
* **Dynamic routing** for user profiles and content discovery

## What I Learned

I learned how to build full-stack applications with proper authentication and data flow. I now understand how to:
* Set up a centralized API client configuration and automatically attach JWT tokens to authenticated requests
* Manage authentication state across an entire React application using Context API
* Store and retrieve JWT tokens securely using localStorage with proper security considerations
* Replace mock data with real backend API responses and handle dynamic content rendering
* Implement proper loading states, error handling, and conditional rendering for better user experience
* Build dynamic pages for user discovery, video upload functionality, and personalized user profiles
* Create social features like following/unfollowing users and viewing personalized content feeds

This helped me understand how modern web applications handle real-time data, user authentication, and personalized content delivery in production environments.

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

**Challenge 1: Authentication State Management**
* **Problem:** I had difficulty managing the authentication flow correctly across the entire application, especially maintaining login state between page refreshes and route changes
* **Solution:** I solved this by implementing an `AuthProvider` using React Context to centrally manage user authentication state and ensure consistent UI updates based on login status

**Challenge 2: Data Integration and Mock Data Replacement**
* **Problem:** I faced issues replacing mock video data with real backend responses, causing components to break due to different data structures and missing properties
* **Solution:** I solved this by carefully updating the video and user services to fetch data using Axios, ensuring proper data transformation and that all components received the correct props with appropriate fallback values

**Challenge 3: Error Handling and Loading States**
* **Problem:** The application didn't handle loading states and API errors gracefully, leading to poor user experience during data fetching
* **Solution:** I implemented proper error handling with try-catch blocks, loading indicators, and conditional rendering to provide appropriate feedback to users during different application states

## Conclusion

This practical gave me comprehensive experience in full-stack web development with modern technologies. Key achievements include:
* Understanding how to integrate frontend and backend applications with secure authentication
* Learning to manage complex application state and user sessions effectively
* Gaining experience with real-time data fetching and dynamic content rendering
* Building confidence in handling API integration, error states, and user experience optimization
* Understanding the architecture of social media applications with personalized content delivery

Overall, this practical significantly improved my skills in connecting frontend and backend systems, managing user authentication, and creating personalized user experiences. I now feel confident building full-stack applications that handle real user data, secure authentication, and complex social features like those found in modern social media platforms.
